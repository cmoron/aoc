    Extracts columns from a given matrix.

    This function iterates over each column index of the matrix and collects elements

    Parameters:
    matrix (list of lists): A 2D list representing the matrix from which columns are to be extracted.

    list of lists: A list where each element is a list representing a column of the input matrix.

    [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

def picks_theorem(area, boundaries):
    """
    Calculate the number of interior points in a simple polygon using Pick's Theorem.

    Pick's Theorem is used to relate the area of a simple polygon to the number of its interior and boundary points.
    The theorem states that the area of the polygon (A) can be calculated using the formula: A = i + b/2 - 1,
    where i is the number of interior points and b is the number of boundary points.

    Parameters:
    area (float or int): The area of the polygon. The total space within the boundary of the polygon.
    boundaries (int): The number of boundary points of the polygon. Points that lie on the perimeter of the polygon.

    Returns:
    int: The number of interior points within the polygon calculated using the formula: i = A - b/2 + 1,
         where i is the number of interior points, A is the area, and b is the number of boundary points.

    Example:
    >>> picks_theorem(20.5, 14)
    13.75

    Note:
    - Assumes the polygon is simple (does not intersect itself).
    - The area should be provided in a unit consistent with the boundary points.
    - Boundary points are considered as points lying exactly on the edge of the polygon.
    - Result accuracy depends on the accuracy of the input values for area and boundary points.

def shoelace_formula(vertex):
    """
    Calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices using the Shoelace formula.

    The Shoelace formula, also known as Gauss's area formula, computes the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are described in a sequence. The formula is given by: A = 1/2 * âˆ‘(x_i * (y_(i+1) - y_(i-1))), for i = 1 to n, where A is the area of the polygon and n is the number of vertices.

    Parameters:
    vertex (list of tuples): A list of tuples representing the vertices of the polygon. Each tuple should contain two values (x, y), representing the coordinates of each vertex.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the polygon. The result is always non-negative.

    Example:
    >>> shoelace_formula([(0,0), (4,0), (4,4), (0,4)])
    16.0

    Note:
    - Assumes the polygon is simple (does not self-intersect).
    - The vertices should be provided in a consistent order (either clockwise or counterclockwise).
    - The first vertex does not need to be repeated at the end of the list.
    - The function is sensitive to the order of the vertices. Reversing the order will give the same area.
